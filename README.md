# Calendar App

### About
This is a calendar app that allows users to create, share, and manage their events. 

This app was built using vanilla Javascript and deployed on an EC2 instance with MySQL as the database. The project was developed in collaboration with [Yunfan Wang](https://github.com/LucunJi) during the Rapid Prototype Development class in the Spring semester of 2021. 

### Features:
* Registered users can access a month-by-month view of the calendar, and easily add and edit their events 
* Users can add, edit and delete tags for each event, and disable events
* Each user can share events with other users
* Each event can belong to a group, which allows each member to edit the eventâ€™s details
